# Reduce friction between decision and donation

> "How might we reduce the friction between the decision to donate and the act of donating?"

Whilst it is easier than ever before for us to hear increasingly personal stories about those in need,  the experience of donating often leaves donors feeling disconnected from the cause that inspired them to donate. In many cases the donations process has not kept pace with significant improvements in payment expereince. Many individuals are left frustrated or disenfranchised by the donation process itself. Those moments between a decision to donate and the act of donation are vital to ensuring the donor is left feeling confident that their donation has reached the cause that inspired them to donate.

As part of this design challenge, we will work to design an improved donations experience that cultivates a connection between the decision to donate, and the donation itself.

## Our Assumptions

* We believe that people want to donate directly to recipients rather than go through a charity.
* We assume there is a lack of trust in charities and that this introduces friction.
* We believe that people have empathy for the recipients.
* We assume that people will donate more if they understand the impact and feel there is transparency.
* We believe that finding information about how money is used is very difficult.
* We assume people suffer from selection anxiety when choosing a charity.
* We believe that people donate to causes that are well advertised or have a powerful story.
* We assume that people are touched by personal stories.
* We assume there is correlation between friction following decision to donate and a positive donation experience.
* We believe that there is a parallel between retail experience and donation experience.
* We assume charities are receptive to ideas for improving the donations process.
