# How might we reduce the friction between the decision to donate and the act of donating?

Whilst it is easier than ever before for us to hear increasingly personal stories about those in need,  the experience of donating often leaves donors feeling disconnected from the cause that inspired them to donate. In many cases the donations process has not kept pace with significant improvements in payment expereince. Many individuals are left frustrated or disenfranchised by the donation process itself. Those moments between a decision to donate and the act of donation are vital to ensuring the donor is left feeling confident that their donation has reached the cause that inspired them to donate.

As part of this design challenge, we will work to design an improved donations experience that cultivates a connection between the decision to donate, and the donation itself.
