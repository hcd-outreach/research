# How might we share the impact of a donation with a donor?

There are many digital donation platforms available out there today. While many of these successfully engage prospective donors causing empathetic perspective, it’s difficult to find any that effectively share the impact each donor has made with the donation to provide more in-depth connection between donors and recipients. For instance, a regular report in a timely manner of how a donation is used or a reaction from recipients of how the donation is making a significant impact on their needs would bring understanding of a donation’s impact and will more strongly motivate prospective donors. 

As part of this design challenge, we will design solutions that effectively deliver the impact to prospective / current / past donors. These could possibly engage more donors and open a new door for more in-depth connection between donors and recipients.
