# How might we encourage more repeat donations?

Charities and NGOs, especially smaller ones, can benefit from consistent engagement from donors. However, to attract repeated or recurring donations, the question becomes what types of services or information can an organization provide and what do donors want or expect to ensure repeated donation? Additionally, what would be the most convenient and encouraging way to maximize donor satisfaction and engagement for each donation? For instance, can charities provide regular financial breakdowns or reports; and what is the optimal method for making repeated donations?

As part of this design challenge, we will interview both charities and regular charitable donors to find solutions to match providable information with expectation in addition to optimal method for engagement and communication.
