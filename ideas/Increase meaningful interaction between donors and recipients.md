# How might we increase meaningful interaction between donors and recipients?

While more and more NGOs work on promoting the reason to donate via different platforms, the backchannel after a completed donation is mostly not existing. Today's communication channels offer opportunities of real and personal interactions which can make a huge impact in changing the meaning of a donation from a 'goodwill' single action to an experience that gives more than just a good conscience.

As part of the design challenge, we will work to design new solutions that create a backchannel between recipients and donors to sharpen the donors understanding of the problems source and bring the world closer together.
