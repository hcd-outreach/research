# Charity Miles

## Summary

There is no way to directly donate to a charitable cause. Money donated to charity comes from sponsors who pay for advertising slots. Without starting an activity, it isn’t clear where these adverts are shown.

The chatbot style sign-up process is friendly and makes things clear, however if you don’t already know what your chosen charity does, it is difficult to identify any further information about the charity.

There appears to be no feedback at all on how the money is used.
