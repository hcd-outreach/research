# Go Fund Me

## Summary
This has both web and mobile app.
Individuals can start a fund-raising campaign and people usually do this by uploading photos and story.

GoFundMe asks you to sign in/sign up at the very beginning of the app. 
Below is the policy I found from their website.
This policy shows with the sign in page.

> Policy:
